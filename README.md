# Interested in working for Famly?

I AM VERY INTERESTED! üòç

## How to get started
- download the project
- use termninal for next steps, you are gonne need NPM installed.
- cd hire-me/haci
- npm i;
- npm run dev;
- it should be working, if it doesn't call support on (insert my number).

some of my decisions: 
- I usually do the components folders, I like to have everything related gathered in the same place 
- I like to do themes usually so I like the use of css-variables
- I would have used a state-manager but I wanted to do as much possible in as little time as possible, so did not get to add that.
- I would have gone deeper with the Types if I had the time
- Pagination is done with react hooks but maybe it would have been better with search params
