# Interested in working for Famly?

I AM VERY INTERESTED! 😍

## How to get started
- download the project
- use termninal for next steps, you are gonne need NPM installed.
- cd hire-me/haci
- npm i;
- npm run dev;
- it should be working, if it doesn't call support on +4528102814(joke😂).

some of my decisions: 
I usually do the components folders, I like to have everything related gathered in the same place 
I like to do themes usually so I like the use of css-variables
usually I would have used a state-manager but I wanted to do as much possible in as little time as possible,
I would have gone deeper with the Types if I had the time
Pagination is done with react hooks but in a real life situations maybe it would have been better with search params
